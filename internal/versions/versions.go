// APIVersion represents the overall version of Foundation's semantics, which
// are built into Foundation itself (i.e. is not versioned as part of the
// foundation repository). Whenever new non-backwards compatible semantics are
// added to Foundation, this number must be bumped.
const APIVersion = 30

// MinimumAPIVersion represents the minimum requested version that this version
// of foundation supports. If a module requests, e.g. a minimum version of 28,
// which is below the version here specified, then Foundation will fail with a
// error that says our version of Foundation is too recent. This is used during
// development when maintaining backwards compatibility is too expensive.ÃŸ

// Allow for global cache invalidation.
