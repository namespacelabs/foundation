# Contributing to Foundation

This guide is targeted at the Namespace Labs team for now.

## Developing

Developing `ns` requires Docker and `nix`. Use your operating system's preferred method to install
Docker (e.g. Docker Desktop on MacOS).

We use `nix` to guarantee a stable development environment (it's not used throughout yet, e.g. for
releases, but that's a work in progress).

- Install `nix` to your target environment, https://nixos.org/download.html. Both Linux (and WSL2)
  as well as MacOS are supported.

Foundation is regularly tested under Linux, MacOS 11+ and Windows WSL2.

After `nix` is installed, you can:

- Use `nix-shell` to jump into a shell with all the current dependencies setup (e.g. Go, NodeJS,
  etc).
- Use the "nix environment selector" VSCode extension to apply a nix environment in VSCode.
- Or use the pre-configured VSCode devcontainer.

## Building

```bash
git clone git@github.com:namespacelabs/foundation.git
go install -v ./cmd/ns
ns
```

## Releasing

We use `goreleaser` for our releases. You should have it under your `nix-shell`.

You can test a release by running:

```bash
goreleaser release --rm-dist --snapshot
```

To issue an actual release, create a Github PAT with `write_packages` permissions and place it in
`~/.github/github_token`.

Our versioning scheme uses a ever-increasing minor version. After `0.0.23` comes `0.0.24`, and so
on.

Pick a new version, and run:

```bash
git tag -a v0.0.24
goreleaser release
```

NOTE: all commits end up in an automatically generated changelog. Commits that include `docs:`,
`test:` or `nochangelog` are excluded from the changelog.

### MacOS Notarization

In order to allow `ns` binaries to be installed outside of the App store, they need to be notarized.

Notarization must be done in MacOSX, and requires XCode, and
https://github.com/mitchellh/gon#installation.

## Development Workflows

### Debugging via VS Code

The debugging configuration is not in the repository because different people may want to used
different arguments. To bootstrap, create `.vscode/launch.json` and add the following content:

```
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Foundation",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "debug",
      "program": "${workspaceRoot}/cmd/ns",
      // This is important, otherwise debugging doesn't work.
      "env": { "CGO_ENABLED": "0" },
      // Specify the absolute path to the working directory.
      "cwd": "~/code/foundation",
      "args": ["generate"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Protos

We use protos in various parts of our codebase. Code gen for protos is managed manually. You can run
`ns source protogen` to update the generated files.

At times you'll also see JSON being used directly, this is often of two forms:

(a) We use protojson to ship proto values to the frontend, as there's no great jspb (or equivalent)
support for us to rely on.

(b) Adding one more proto was cumbersome, and for iteration purposes we ended up with inline JSON
definitions. It's a hard iteration speed trade-off (because of the manual codegen bit), but we
should lean on protos more permanently.

### Changing node definitions (extensions, service, server)

Changing a definition which impacts codegen (i.e. services are exported, or extension
initializations are registered), requires a codegen refresh. This is done automatically as a part of
`ns build/deploy/dev` but can also be triggered manually:

```bash
ns generate
```

### Rebuild prebuilts

At the moment, "prebuilts" are stored in GCP's Artifact Registry. Accessing these packages requires
no authentication. However, you'll have to sign-in in order to update these prebuilts.

Run `gcloud auth login` to authenticate to GCP with your `namespacelabs.com` account, and then
whenever you need to write new prebuilt images, you'll have to run:

```bash
ns build-binary --all --build_platforms=linux/arm64,linux/amd64 \
     --output_prebuilts --base_repository=us-docker.pkg.dev/foundation-344819/prebuilts/ --log_actions
```

You can then update the `prebuilt_binary` definitions in `workspace.textpb` with the values above.

### Inspect computed schemas

Any node type:

```bash
nsdev debug print-computed std/testdata/server/gogrpc
```

For servers:

```bash
nsdev debug print-sealed std/testdata/server/gogrpc
```

### Debugging latency

`ns` exports tracing information if configured to use Jaeger.

First, Jaeger needs to be running.

```bash
nsdev debug prepare
```

And then configure `ns` to push traces, either set `enable_tracing` unconditionally in
`~/.config/fn/config.json` or per invocation:

```bash
FN_ENABLE_TRACING=true ns build ...
```

Check out the trace at http://localhost:20000/.

### Iterating on the internal Dev UI

```bash
ns dev --devweb std/testdata/server/gogrpc
```

Adding `--devweb` starts a development web frontend. Yarn and NodeJS are required for `--devweb`.
Also, run `yarn install` in the `devworkflow/web` directory to fetch and link node dependencies.

```bash
ns dev -H 0.0.0.0:4001 --devweb std/testdata/server/gogrpc
```

Use `-H` to change the listening hostname/port, in case you're running `ns dev` in a machine or VM
different from your workstation.

### Using `age` for simple secret management

When a server has secrets required for deployment, sharing those secrets between different users can
sometimes be challenging. Foundation includes a simple solution for it, building on `age`.

Users generate pub/private identities using `ns keys generate`, which can then be used to encrypt
"secret bundles" which are submittable into the repository. Access to the payload is determined by
the keys which have been added as receipients to the encrypted payload. This list of keys is public,
and kept in the repository as part of the bundle.

```
$ ns keys generate
Created age1kacjakcg8dqyxzdwldemrx4pt79ructa6z0mgw7nk03mgxl3vqsslph4fz
```

```
$ ns secrets set std/testdata/server/gogrpc --secret namespacelabs.dev/foundation/std/testdata/datastore:cert

Specify a value for "cert" in namespacelabs.dev/foundation/std/testdata/datastore.

Value: <value>

Wrote std/testdata/server/gogrpc/server.secrets
```

A `server.secrets` will be produced which can be submitted to the repository, as the secret values
are encrypted.

To grant access to the encrypted file, merely have your teammate generate a key (see above), add
run:

```
$ ns secrets add-reader std/testdata/server/gogrpc --key <pubkey>
Wrote std/testdata/server/gogrpc/server.secrets
```

The resulting file can then be submitted to the repository.

To inspect who has access to the bundle, and which secrets are stored, run:

```
$ ns secrets info std/testdata/server/gogrpc
Readers:
  age1mlefr5zhnesgzfl7aefy95qlem0feuyfpdpmee6lk50x4h6mlskqdffjxv
Definitions:
  namespacelabs.dev/foundation/std/testdata/datastore:cert
```

Note: this mechanism for secret management does not handle revocations. If a key has been issued
which should no longer have access to the contents, all secret values should be considered
compromised and replaced (as the person with private key can read the values from any previous
repository commit).
