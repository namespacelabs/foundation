### **About Namespace**

Namespace is an application development platform that helps you manage your development, testing, and production workflows, in a consistent and unified way.

You describe the servers in your application, how they're built, their relationship, and which additional resources they need. And from that description -- built out of a set of composable and extensible blocks -- Namespace orchestrates:

- **Build**: start with your Dockerfiles, or use one of our language-specific integrations, so you don't have to manage Dockerfiles manually. Apart from their ease of use, language-specific integrations set up your build and development environment with the latest best practices and make harder things simple (e.g., support multiple platforms).

- **Development environment**: With Namespace, you don't need to manage your development dependencies manually -- the days of asking folks in the team to install the right SDK versions will be gone. Instead, we'll manage SDKs and dependencies on your behalf. As a result, getting someone new onboarded into the application development environment will take minutes rather than hours or days.

- **Representative environments**: How often have you hit bugs in production or testing that are hard to reproduce locally? Namespace helps you bridge the gap between environments, managing production-like environments across development and testing.

- **Effortless end-to-end testing**: When you have an application setup with Namespace, writing an end-to-end system test becomes simple. From the same application definition used to set up a development environment, Namespace is also capable of creating ephemeral testing environments used to run end-to-end tests.

- **Kubernetes**: (but you don't need to care). We help you and your team to think about concepts you care about: services, resources, backends, etc. Under the covers, you'll find industry-standard Kubernetes and CNCF projects, which means that as you grow or need, you can easily tap into the broad Kubernetes ecosystem. No hidden implementation, and no vendor lock-in.

- **Packaged dependencies**: adding support infrastructure or a resource -- whether it's a storage bucket, a database, a messaging system, etc. -- it's as simple as adding a dependency to your application.

### **Getting Started**

To get started follow our [getting started guide](https://docs.namespace.so/getting-started/). After installing `ns`, explore some of the [examples](/namespacelabs/examples) our team put together.
